# Medical/Bio Research Topics 2
## 1. Course Description

In this class, introduction to brain imaging data as clinical data by focusing on structural MRI data, explanation for processing structural MRI data, and practice in developing structural MRI-based artificial intelligence models are covered.


## 2. Prerequisites

For this class, basic knowledge of artificial intelligence modelling and understanding of programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, and R are desired.


## 3. Course Format

Lecture	60%

Discussion/Presentation 30%

Experiment/Practicum 10%

In this class, lectures on introduction to brain imaging data, especially structural MRI data, and processing of structural MRI data are given, and then students actually develop structural MRI-based artificial intelligence models and present and discuss the performance and interpretation of the developed models.


## 4. Course Objectives

Through this class, students understand methods for processing structural MRI data and secure knowledge and experience in the development of structural MRI-based artificial intelligence models.


## 5. Evaluation System

Presentation 90%

Participation 10%

The development process and results of structural MRI-based artificial intelligence models for three topics are evaluated through presentation and discussion.
